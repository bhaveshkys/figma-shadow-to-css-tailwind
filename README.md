# Shadow Generator

This project is a simple React application that generates CSS and Tailwind CSS code for box shadows based on user input. The application allows users to input values such as `inset`, `x offset`, `y offset`, `blur`, `spread`, `color`, and `transparency`, and then converts these inputs into CSS or Tailwind code. The generated code can be easily copied to the clipboard for use in your projects.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Form**: Input your shadow properties through a clean and simple form.
- **CSS and Tailwind Code Generation**: Instantly generate CSS and Tailwind CSS code for your shadow styles.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Quickly copy the generated code to your clipboard with the click of a button.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, making it easy to use on any device.
